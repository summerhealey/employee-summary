# Employee Summary Generator Guidelines

This is a a software engineering team generator command line application that dynamically generates a visual team summary with user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). The application will be invoked with the following command:

```
node app.js
```
This application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This generator has passed all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. 

The specific features of the application are outlined in the acceptance criteria provided by the client.
